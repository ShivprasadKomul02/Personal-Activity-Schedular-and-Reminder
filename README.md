# Personal Activity Scheduler and Reminder Mobile application
The motivation behind this project is Sometimes we have been told 
some important work and we forget it. It is not clear how big the effect is. 
Because the time that has gone is not coming back. At the same time, we have 
to do various things in everyday life, but we do not remember all the time and 
all the work. So, for that We are making an Android application to address 
this. 

So that the app will remind you of what work to do in everyday life 
and keep records of all the tasks and work we have to complete in a particular 
day and remember that work. So that without any obstacle all the work will be 
done in a timely way
